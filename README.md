# Problem_Solving_C
We will discuss three levels in problem Solving with their answers. It is recommended to start solving problem solving questions while studying. Starting to solve problem-solving questions while studying C programming offers several advantages:

#### Enhances understanding of concepts: 
Problem-solving questions require you to apply the concepts you've learned in C programming. By solving these questions, you gain a deeper understanding of how to use language features, data structures, and algorithms to solve real-world problems.

#### Improves coding skills:
Regularly practicing problem-solving questions helps improve your coding skills in C. You become more familiar with the syntax, structure, and best practices of the language. Also it enhances your ability to write clean, efficient, and readable code.

#### Builds problem-solving skills: 
Problem-solving questions challenge you to think critically and analytically. They improve your ability to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. This skill is essential not only in programming but also in various other domains.

#### Increases familiarity with common algorithms and data structures: 
Problem-solving questions often involve the use of fundamental algorithms and data structures. By solving a variety of problems, you become more comfortable with concepts like sorting, searching, linked lists, arrays, stacks, queues, and more.

#### Prepares for coding interviews: 
If you're planning to pursue a career in software development, problem-solving questions are a common part of coding interviews. By practicing these questions early on, you become better prepared for coding interviews, as you develop problem-solving strategies and gain confidence in your coding abilities.

#### Encourages creativity and innovation:
Problem-solving questions allow you to think creatively and find innovative solutions to challenges. It promotes a mindset of exploring different approaches, optimizing code, and finding elegant solutions.

#### Builds resilience and perseverance: 
Problem-solving can sometimes be challenging and require perseverance. By regularly tackling difficult problems, you develop resilience and the ability to tackle complex programming tasks with determination and patience.

# Problem_Solving_1
It contains 12 different tasks for the basic level of C. This PDF focuses on introducing fundamental problem-solving concepts and techniques in C programming. It is designed for beginners or individuals who are new to programming. The problems in this PDF typically cover basic programming constructs such as patterns, loops, conditionals, functions. The emphasis is on building a strong foundation in problem-solving and getting familiar with common programming patterns.

# Problem_Solving_2
It contains 7 different tasks for the intermediate level of C. The intermediate level PDF builds upon the basics and introduces more complex problem-solving challenges. It assumes a solid understanding of programming fundamentals and delves into topics such as pointers, arrays, functions ans string.

# Problem_Solving_3
It contains 12 different tasks for the advanced level of C. The advanced level PDF is intended for experienced programmers looking to further enhance their problem-solving skills. It covers functions, enums, structures, string and libraries. The problems in this PDF are typically more complex and require knowladge in embeded C. Solving problems from this PDF helps expand your problem-solving abilities to tackle challenging and intricate programming tasks.

# Usage
To compile and run the task, follow these steps:

    1-Install a C compiler (e.g., GCC) on your system if you haven't already(Notepad++,CodeBlocks,eclipse,...).
    2-Download the source code file.
    3-Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
    4-Compile the source code using the command: gcc main.c presentation.c business.c data_access.c -o school_management_system.
    5-Run the compiled executable.
